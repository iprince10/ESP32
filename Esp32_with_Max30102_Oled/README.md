# ESP32 with MAX30102 & OLED

This project is a heart rate monitoring system using ESP32 and MAX30102 sensor. It measures pulse rate (BPM) using an optical sensor and displays the output on a 0.96 inch OLED screen. The system also prints readings on the serial monitor for debugging.

## Features

- Heart rate (BPM) measurement using MAX30102  
- Optical pulse detection using IR sensor  
- Real-time display on OLED (SSD1306 128x64)  
- Serial monitor output for debugging  
- Compact and efficient design  
- Suitable for health monitoring applications  

## Components Required

- ESP32  
- MAX30102 Pulse Oximeter Sensor  
- 0.96" OLED Display (SSD1306, I2C)  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper wires  
- USB cable  

## Circuit Connections

### MAX30102 Sensor (I2C)
- VCC  -> 3.3V  
- GND  -> GND  
- SDA  -> GPIO21  
- SCL  -> GPIO22  

### OLED Display (SSD1306 I2C)
- VCC  -> 3.3V  
- GND  -> GND  
- SDA  -> GPIO21  
- SCL  -> GPIO22  

## Working

- The MAX30102 sensor detects pulse rate using infrared light.  
- When a finger is placed on the sensor, variations in blood flow are detected.  
- The ESP32 processes the signal and calculates BPM (beats per minute).  
- The calculated BPM is displayed on the OLED screen.  
- Serial monitor prints IR values and BPM for debugging.  
- If no finger is detected, readings may show zero or unstable values.
